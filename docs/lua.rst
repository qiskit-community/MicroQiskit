MicroQiskit Library Reference
*****************************

A version of Qiskit made for educational purposes.
See https://qiskit.org for more on Qiskit.

.. module:: microqiskit

.. function:: simulate(qc,get,counts):

    This is the MicroQiskit equivalent of the ``execute`` function in Qiskit.

    Runs the quantum circuit ``qc``. Results are given from multiple runs, the
    number of which is specified by ``shots``. The type of output is specified
    by ``get``, which can be set to ``'counts'``, ``'memory'`` or ``'statevector'``.
    If no ``shots`` is supplied, a default value of 1024 is used.
        
    Note that, for a ``'statevector'`` output, complex numbers are specified as a two
    element table instead of Python complex number notation. So a
    number ``a+bj`` will become ``{a,b}``.
    
    Note that the  ``'counts'`` output is generated by a sampling process, which
    can be too slow for some use cases. This can be avoided by using ``'fast counts'``,
    which instead returns the expectation value of the counts.

.. class:: QuantumCircuit()

    Contains a quantum circuit, which is essentially a list of quantum gates
    that are applied to a register of qubits. At the end, a binary output is
    recorded on a register of bits.
    
    This is the MicroQiskit version of the identically named class in Qiskit.

    .. classmethod:: set_registers(num_qubits, num_bits)
    
        Initializes a circuit with ``num_qubits`` qubits and ``num_bits`` output bits.
        The latter need not be supplied in the case of a ``'statevector'`` output.
        
        Note that, in the full version of Qiskit, this information is supplied when
        initializing ``QuantumCircuit``.
        
    .. classmethod:: initialize(ket)
    
        Initializes a circuit with the state described by the statevector ``ket``.
    
    .. classmethod:: x(qubit)
    
        Adds an ``x`` gate to the circuit on the given qubit.
    
    .. classmethod:: rx(theta,qubit)
    
        Adds rotation around the x axis to the circuit on the given qubit. The
        angle is given by ``theta``.
    
    .. classmethod:: ry(theta,qubit)
    
        Adds rotation around the y axis to the circuit on the given qubit. The
        angle is given by ``theta``.
    
    .. classmethod:: rz(theta,qubit)
    
        Adds rotation around the z axis to the circuit on the given qubit. The
        angle is given by ``theta``.
    
    .. classmethod:: h(qubit)
    
        Adds an ``h`` gate to the circuit on the given qubit.
    
    .. classmethod:: cx(control,target)
    
        Adds a ``cx`` gate to the circuit for the given control and target qubits.
    
    .. classmethod:: measure(qubit,bit)
    
        Adds a measure gate, which extracts a bit of output from the given qubit.
        Note that, unlike in the full version of Qiskit, measurements are always
        applied at the end, irrespective of where they are placed in the circuit.
