    "## Introduction to MicroQiskit\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit is the largest, most feature rich and most well developed framework for quantum computing. This is obviously a good thing in general, but it can be overwhelming for those getting started.\n",
    "\n",
    "For that reason, we have created MicroQiskit: the smallest, least feature rich and least developed framework for quantum computing! It has everything you need to get to know single and two qubit circuits, and do so with the same syntax as Qiskit. By mastering MicroQiskit, you'll be well on your way to mastering Qiskit.\n",
    "\n",
    "MicroQiskit has also been designed to be able to work on microcontroller devices. This includes the PewPew, as well as many other devices used for education and hobbies. It is compatible with MicroPython and CircuitPython, both of which are minimal implementations of Python designed to run on microcontrollers. Many Python packages have minimal versions made to be compatible with these implementations. MicroQiskit is similarly the MicroPython-compatible version of Qiskit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basics of MicroQiskit (and Qiskit)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "The heart of quantum computing is the circuit. In Qiskit and MicroQiskit, our circuit is represented by a Python object, known as the `QuantumCircuit` object. The following line creates such an object, and names it `qc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "qc = QuantumCircuit(n,n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the first `n` is the number of qubits, and the second `n` is the number of output bits. In Qiskit, these can be different numbers in general. However, they are often simply chosen to be equal. MicroQiskit restricts us to this standard case. MicroQiskit also retricts to `n` being either 1 or 2, as it cannot simulate larger numbers of qubits. Many interesting things can be done with just two qubits, so this will not hamper us. However, Qiskit supports any number of qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum gates\n",
    "\n",
    "The gates that can be added to a quantum circuit are\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "qc.x(j)\n",
    "qc.h(j)\n",
    "qc.rx(theta,j)\n",
    "qc.rz(theta,j)\n",
    "qc.ry(theta,j)\n",
    "qc.cx(j,k)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here `j` is the number representing the qubit: `0` for a single qubit circuit, or `0` and `1` for a two qubit circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other gates are also available in Qiskit. However, since everything can be built out of the basic operations we have here, nothing is lost in MicroQiskit by restricting to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement is the process of extracting an output from a qubit. These outputs take the form of normal bits. There are an infinite number of ways we can choose to do this, but normally we stick to just three. The most common is the *z measurement*, which is performed using the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# z measurement of qubit j\n",
    "qc.measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This measures qubit `j` and places the result in output bit `j`. In Qiskit, these two arguments do not neccessarily need to be equal: the labelling of a qubit and the bit used for its output can be different. However, they are often chosen to be the same. MicroQiskit only supports this standard case, so the two arguments must be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other standard forms of measurement are the *x measurement*, which is performed using\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# x measurement of qubit j\n",
    "qc.h(j)\n",
    "qc.measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and the *y measurement*\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# y measurement of qubit j\n",
    "qc.rx(pi/2,j)\n",
    "qc.measure(j,j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurements in Qiskit can be placed at any point in the circuit. The simulators of Qiskit will quite happily run such quantum programs. However, when running on current prototype quantum hardware, the only supported case is to have all measurements made at the very end. This is also only case supported by MicroQiskit, so no gates for a given qubit should be placed after its measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulating a Circuit\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard Qiskit, circuits can be run on various simulators as well as real quantum devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! That's what I said! Real prototype quantum processes are sitting on the cloud, waiting for you to experiment with. It's free and available to all. Check it out [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are many ways to run a quantum circuit with Qiskit, the procedure for running circuits and extracting results in Qiskit is designed to handle all these various use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MicroQiskit, there is only one way to run a circuit: to simulate it on the MicroQiskit simulator. For this reason, running circuits is slightly easier in MicroQiskit. The process is implemented by a single function, called `simulate()`. This has an argument `shots`, which determines how many times you wish to repeatedly run the circuit to extract statistics. It also has an argument `get` which determines the form in which the results are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to get a list of `shots=5` output bit strings, use\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "m = simulate(qc,shots=5,get='memory')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The result will look something like `m = ['1','0','1','0','0']`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a dictionary detailing how many of `shots=1024` samples result in each output, use\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "c = simulate(qc,shots=1024,get='counts')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The result will look something like `c = {'0':502,'1':522}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a state vector describing the state at output, no measurement gates or output bits are required. You are therefore able to initialize the circuit with\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "qc = QuantumCircuit(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The state vector is extracted with\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "state = simulate(qc,shots=1024,get='statevector')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The Qiskit equivalents of the commands listed above are very similar to their MicroQiskit counterparts. Specifically, they are\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "m = execute(qc,backend,shots=5,memory=True).result().get_memory()\n",
    "c = execute(qc,backend,shots=1024).result().get_counts()\n",
    "state = execute(qc,backend,shots=1024).result().get_statevector()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note also that the format for complex numbers in the statevector is different in MicroQiskit. A complex number of the form $a + i b$ is represented by the list `[a,b]` in MicroQiskit, rather than `a + bj` as in Qiskit. A statevector composed only of real numbers can be initialized with a list of real numbers as normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Qubit on the PewPew\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now use our quantum tools on the PewPew. To do this, take the file named 'MicroQiskit.py', included in this folder, and place it on your PewPew. You will then be able to run the program below. If you are running an emulator on your own device, make sure that 'MicroQiskit.py' is in the same folder as the 'Pew.py' file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following program shows a simple example of using MicroQiskit. Two circuits are created\n",

    "m_z.measure(0,0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is the main circuit that will hold our quantum program. The second simply provides the measurement needed at the end. The final circuit that is run is `qc+m_z`, which corresponds to the contents of `qc`, following by those of `m_z`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end result of the circuit is used to set the brightness of the pixel at (6,6), with it going dark for the output `0`, and bright for `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'Up' and 'Down' buttons can be used to add gates to `qc`. The 'Up' button is used for `x`. This acts like a classical NOT gate by flipping between `0` and `1`. The 'Down' button adds `h`, a gate which will need a little explanation. But first, experiment for yourself."
